#Macro App

##Details
A simple automation tool for keyboard and mouse inputs. Allows record and playback functionality as well as manual editing afterwards. Supports hotkeys for starting and stopping.

##Purpose
I made it mainly to automate some simple repetitive game tasks.

##How to Run
With python (and the relevant imports) installed, running the main.py file should work. I also used pyinstaller to bundle it into one executable which is another option, though the executable is not in this repo.

##Status
It should be finished, though there may be some bugs that I haven't noticed. My testing wasn't extremely thorough. For basic usage it will work.
If I ever decide I want to add something in the future, I might come back, but for now I'm declaring it done.
